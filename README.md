Dear Mehdi:
I would like to provide a brief clarification regarding the project I shared. It was my most recent industry project though it created in 2021 year, deployed on a Jetson Nano platform from 2021~2022. Although I left the company earlier, the system continued to evolve afterward.
During the interview, I realized that I had not specifically prepared for detailed C++ theory questions. My second bachelor's degree learning period from 2023 ~ now，this period I focus more on theory of embedded system, Python-based work. so , actually , in the interview , I relied mainly on experience from the memory. 

The picture below shows the Lidar data and video data from the jetson nano and the related link is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Z8EBj9Y_Q
