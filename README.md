Dear Mehdi:

I would like to briefly clarify that the project (The code is divided into hardware and software part)I shared with you was developed from scratch. It was my most recent industry project (hardware part) though it created in 2021 year, deployed on a Jetson Nano platform. Although I left the company earlier, the system continued to use afterward.
During the interview, I realized that I had not specifically prepared for detailed C++ theory questions. You might know My second bachelor's degree learning period from 2023 ~ now，this period I focus more on theory of embedded system, Python-based work. so , actually , in the interview , I relied mainly on experience from the memory. 

The picture below is the Application (software part) installed on the windows system , shows the Lidar data and video data received from the jetson nano and the related link is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7Z8EBj9Y_Q
