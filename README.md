Mehdi:
hope you will read this words,
The  project is my lastest real work peoject（deployed on the jetson nano ） in the 2023 year and I quited the company at 2022 year and I knew the company has bankrupted. actually , in the interview I have no any preparation about the C++ and just used my memory to answer the questions because I more focus on the AI and python laguage and I just thought you will ask more about the project itself.
